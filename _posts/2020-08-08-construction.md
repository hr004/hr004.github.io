## Different types of testing
1. Funtional testing
    Focuses on the result of the function. Does it satisfy the requirements? Examine input and output of a function. For a given classification problem ensure that ```predict or inference``` method works as expected.
2. Non-functional testing
    Tests the usability of the product. Does it make inference within the given timeframe? Is there any security vulnerability? Does it maintain compliance? 
     - Usability testing
        Tests from an end user's perspective to see if the system is easy to use
     - Performance testing
        How the system performs under a certain load. TODO: load testing for ml models?
        check the following things:
            - responsivensess
            - concurrency
            - reliabilitiy
            - stability
            - scalability
     - Security testing
        security of OS, database and other software the application depends on
     - Compliance testing

3. Regression testing
    a type of change-related testing to detect whether defects have been introduced  or uncovered in an unchanged areas of the software. Might occur due to defect fix, code refactoring, change in architecture, change in configuation or enviroment
4. Smoke testing
    It's a build verification testing that contains a set of testing that comprises of a non-exhaustive set of tests that aim at ensuring that the most important features work.
